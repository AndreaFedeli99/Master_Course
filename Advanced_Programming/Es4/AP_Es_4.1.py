# To extend the class for the strings to support the following operations:
# 1. To check if the string is palindrome, a string is palindrome when the represented sentence can be read the same way in either directions in spite of spaces, 
#    punctual and letter cases, e.g., detartrated, "Do geese see God?", "Rise to vote, sir.", ...
# 2. To subtract the letters in a string from the letters in another string, e.g., "Walter Cazzola"-"abcwxyz" will give "Wlter Col" 
#    note that the operator - is case sensitive and that the target should be a name containing an instance of the child class
# 3. Given a dictionary of strings, to check if the string is an anagram of one or more of the strings in the dictionary
