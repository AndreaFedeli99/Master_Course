## Exercise 1

**Wordle** is a deceptively simple word puzzle. You're asked to guess the word of the day, which is a five-letter word id English. Wordle basic characteristics canbe summarized in:

- The word is exactly five letters long.
- It is in English and composed of letters, no punctuation, no numbers or other symbols.
- Only 6 guessing are possible for each hidden word.

A guess yields clues:

- A green letter if the character and position in the word is correct.
- A yellow letter if the character is present in the word, but we chose the wrong position.
- A white letter if the character in not in the word at all.

Both hidden and guessed words are/should be taken from a finite number of words, and what is a valid word is limited to the dictionary used by Wordle.

In this exercise, you are asked to write a module `wordle` to automatically play the puzzle. To this respect, we simplify some aspects:

- Only the first guess is given as a starting point all the other guessing are automatically chosen by your implementation.
- Any new guess should be the first one (alphabetically sorted) among those that could fit the hints provided by the oracle.
- The number of guessing is unlimited.

As a dictionary you have the file called `wordlist-worlde.txt`. **Note** that this is a full dictionary, e.i. it contains words of any length and with any character.

The `wordle.py` module must contain (at least) the functions:

- `read_words(fn)` that reads and organizes the dictionary.
- `wordle(guess, wordle, dictionary)` that is in charge of solving the puzzle. It takes the first guess, the hidden word and the dictionary read by the `read_words` funtion, respectively, and returns a list of colored words from the given guess (in position zero) to the hidden word (in the last spot) in the exact order you guessed them.

**Technical Note.** You can ouput colored letters by using ANSI escape codes. For your convenience the following are those that you need:

- White: `\u001b[37;1m`
- Green: `\u001b[32;1m`
- Yellow: `\u001b[33;1m`
- Reset: `\u001b[0m`

A piece of text is printed in a certain color when the corresponding escape code is encountered; the color is maintained until a reset escape code is encountered.

Note that the use of any module is **FORBIDDEN**. The solutions that use a module will be considered **WRONG**.

The following is a main program exercising the module and the expected result. **Note** that any solution whose behaviour differs from this one will be considered **WRONG**.

```py
from wordle import read_words, wordle

def print_wordlet(wordlet):
    for w in wordlet:
        print(w)
    print("\n")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    wl = read_words('wordlist-worlde.txt')
    print_wordlet(wordle('model', 'melon', wl))
    print_wordlet(wordle('slice', 'mount', wl))
    print_wordlet(wordle('crane', 'vowel', wl))
    print_wordlet(wordle('drive', 'sooty', wl))
    print_wordlet(wordle('yacht', 'sassy', wl))
    print_wordlet(wordle('happy', 'roots', wl))
    print_wordlet(wordle('lines', 'hatch', wl))
```

### Output:

```

## Exercise 2

Often objects during their life cycle evolves sometimes changing their interface. Stack clearly shows this point:

- Initially the stack is empty and the `pop()` operation is unacceptable and similarly when it is full it cannot accept `push()` operations. Another example is a `Smeagol` that finding the one ring becomes a `Gollum` enabled just swallow and chant "my precious" eveny once and then.

Normally an object begins with a type and cannot change it without a complete re-installation. Python being a dynamic language is a little bit more flexible and permits to move one instance from a class to another without re-instantiating it. Of course, the messages an object can accept will change when its class changes.

These are the classes that should manifest such a behavior. This code has to be used verbatim and can't be edited:

```py
class Stack:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.__size__ = size
        self.__top__ = 0
        self.__container__ = [0]*size

    def pop(self):
        self.__top__ -= 1
        return self.__container_[self.__top__]
    
    def push(self, e):
        self.__top__ += 1
        self.__container__[self.__top__-1] = e
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "type :- "+type(self).__name__+",\   "+str(self.__top__)+str(self.__size__)+\\
            ",\   container :- ["+', '.join(map(str, self.__container__[:self.__top__]))+']'

class EmptyStack:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.__size__ = size
        self.__top__ = 0
        self.__container__ = [0]*size
    
    def push(self, e):
        self.__top__ += 1
        self.__container__[self.__top__-1] = e
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "type :- "+type(self).__name__+",\   "+str(self.__top__)+str(self.__size__)+\\
            ",\   container :- ["+', '.join(map(str, self.__container__[:self.__top__]))+']'

class FullStack:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.__size__ = size
        self.__top__ = 0
        self.__container__ = [0]*size

    def pop(self):
        self.__top__ -= 1
        return self.__container_[self.__top__]
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "type :- "+type(self).__name__+",\   "+str(self.__top__)+str(self.__size__)+\\
            ",\   container :- ["+', '.join(map(str, self.__container__[:self.__top__]))+']'

class Smeagol:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hasTheRing = False
    
    def found(self, what):
        if what == 'the one ring':
            self.hasTheRing = True
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "type :- "+type(self).__name__+",\ Ring "+('ðŸ—¸' if self.hasTheOneRing else 'x')

class Gollum:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hasTheRing = True
    
    def chant(self): print("My Precious!!!")

    def swallow(self): print("gollllummmm!")

    def lose_the_ring(self): self.hasTheOneRing = False
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "type :- "+type(self).__name__+",\ Ring "+('ðŸ—¸' if self.hasTheOneRing else 'x')
```

The exercise consists of writing a metaclass `ApplySpell` that automatically changes an object class accordingly to some event, e.g., Smeagol gets the one ring, Gollum loses it or a Stack becomes empty/full. NOte that the meta-class should be independent of the event that forces the change.

**Note, the use of any module is FORBIDDEN. The solution that use a module will be considered WRONG**.

```py
from FullStack import FullStack
from EmptyStack import EmptyStack
from Stack import Stack

from Smeagol import Smeagol
from Gollum import Gollum

from ApplySpell import *

if __name__ = "__main__":
    print("s should be a Stack!!!")
    s = Stack(5)
    print(s)
    for elem in [25, 5, 7, 16, 100]:
        s.push(elem)
        print(s)
    for _ in range(s.__size__):
        s.pop()
        print(s)
    print("s1 should be a FullyStack!!!")
    s1 = FullStack(10)
    print(s1)
    try:
        s1.pop()
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(e)
    for elem in range(s1.__size__):
        s1.push(elem)
        print(s1)
    try:
        s1.push(-1)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(e)
    
    print("Into the Middle-Earth")
    smeagol = Smeagol()
    try:
        for item in [ 'a key', 'a sword', 'the one ring', 'a loved one' ]:
            smeagol.found(item)
            print(smeagol)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(e)
    smeagol.chant()
    smeagol.swallow()
    smeagol.swallow()
    smeagol.lose_the_ring()
    try:
        smeagol.chant()
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(e)
    print(smeagol)
```
